***i dont plan to do any updates at all for this in the future. so please refrain from asking. but i do want you to have fun with this & to hopefully learn something & put it to good use*** 😘👍

personal game engine i used in game jams & other projects, [OTO](https://lewislepton.itch.io/otogamejam) for one example. it uses [Kenton Hamaluik](https://github.com/hamaluik) GJK/EPA collision library that ive butchered to my liking for ease of use. engine has used other libraries as well in some areas that were hardest to do, such as tweening, with most libraries having things being renamed in areas to make the syntax feel better & have a better workflow in the end.
